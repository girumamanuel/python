#Ex. 1-2-19Â   Compose a program that takes three floats x0, v0, and t from the command line, evaluates x0 + v0t - Gt2 / 2, and writes the result. (Note: G is the constant 9.80665. This value is the displacement in meters after t seconds when an object is thrown straight up from initial position x0 at velocity v0 meters per second.)


import stdio
import sys
import math

x0 = float(sys.argv[1])
v0 = float(sys.argv[2])
t = float(sys.argv[3])
G= 9.80665

result = x0 + v0*t -(G *(t*t))/2

stdio.writeln(result)
