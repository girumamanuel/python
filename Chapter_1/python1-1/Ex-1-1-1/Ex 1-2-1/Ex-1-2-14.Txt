Ex. 1-2-14 Â 

A physics student gets unexpected results when using the code
force = G * mass1 * mass2 / radius * radius to compute values according to the 
formula F = Gm1m2 / r2. Explain the problem and correct the code.


Ans. Ex. 1-2-14

It should be force = (G * mass1 * mass2) / (radius * radius)
