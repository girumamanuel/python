Programming With Python 

Ex 1.2.1  Suppose that a and b are integers. What does the following sequence of statements do? Draw an object-level trace of this computation.
t = a
b = t
a = b
Ans. Ex 1.2.1 
Assume that a = 1, b = 12
at the beginning:
a --> 1
b --> 12
t=a
t --> 1
b=t
t-->1
a=b
a-->1
At the end: a =b = t
