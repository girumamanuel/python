Programming With Python 

Ex. 1-2-12  

Compose a program that takes three positive integers as command-line arguments and writes False if any one of them is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two and True otherwise. (Note : This computation tests whether the three numbers could be the lengths of the sides of some triangle.)

Ans. Ex. 1-2-12 

import stdio
import sys
import math

a = int(sys.argv[1])
b = int(sys.argv[2])
c = int(sys.argv[3])

stdio.writeln((a >= (b+c)) or (b>= (a+c)) or (c >= (b+a)))
